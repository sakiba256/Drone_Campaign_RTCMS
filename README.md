I've used Playwright to do this Automation.
# Playwright Configuration
 The prerequisites for Playwright are as follows:

1. Operating System:
 Windows, macOS, or Linux: Playwright is compatible with all major operating systems.

2. Node.js:
 Playwright requires Node.js version 14 or higher. Make sure Node.js is installed on your system.
 You can download it from the Node.js official website.

3. Package Manager:
 npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn to install Playwright and its dependencies.

4. Browser Dependencies:
 Playwright automatically downloads the required browser binaries (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) during installation. No additional browser setup is typically needed.

5. Development Tools:
 A code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for writing and debugging scripts.
 Git for version control is optional but useful.

6. Playwright Installation:
 Run the following command to install Playwright:


 npm install playwright
 
 If you want browser dependencies as well, use:
 
 
 npx playwright install

7. Additional Libraries (Optional):
 Testing Frameworks: Playwright Test is included by default, but you can integrate it with Jest, Mocha, or other 
 testing libraries if needed.
 Environment Variables: Use a package like dotenv to manage sensitive data such as credentials.

8. System Permissions:
 Ensure your system allows Node.js and browser processes to run without restrictions.

Additionally, you will need to set your username and password in the logIn.spec.js .
 For run the script with UI Mode (Headed):

   set  headless: false, // Set to false for UI mode in main.spec.js
   Command for run: node main.spec.js 
 For run in background (Headless) need to make:

      headless: true in main.spec.js and 
      Command to run the script: : node main.spec.js 

**N.B** RT CMS is SSO login, need to give Authenticate code to login in the CMS portal
